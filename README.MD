## Description

Wanting to create a game and experiment with different controls and programs outside of Android Studios, we decided to try building in Unity with C# and the main language.  Learning this new language and learning how to use a new series of controls for the device as we gain a better of how different applications and programs work with the Android OS.

The goal is to see how long you can survive in space battling cows and Cowthulu in your space train, the Pew Pew Express, as you dip, dive and dodge oncoming sheep.  How long will you last in this interstellar brawl to be the top of the food chain.
