# Pew Pew Pewnity


A Unity Android app where the player controls a train and battles the cows and they tumble through space.  Using the controls, you must knock out the cows and avoid the sheep long enough to defeat the space overlord, Cowthulu. Brave forward, you crazy train.

## Description

Wanting to create a game and experiment with different controls and programs outside of Android Studios, we decided to try building in Unity with C# and the main language.  Learning this new language and learning how to use a new series of controls for the device as we gain a better of how different applications and programs work with the Android OS.

The goal is to see how long you can survive in space battling cows and Cowthulu in your space train, the Pew Pew Express, as you dip, dive and dodge oncoming sheep.  How long will you last in this interstellar brawl to be the top of the food chain.

## Features

* Score to record number of cows eliminated
* Touch buttons that allow movement of avatar
* Avoid asteroids and oncoming sheep to prevent game over
* See how many cows can be defeated before you are overwhelmed
 
## Score
* Cow : 1 point
* Asteroid : 5 points
* Cowthulu: 10 points
